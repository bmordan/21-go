This is an simple game of Blackjack rendered in GO. I am learning go so this is quite a clumsy implementation. I have used `iota` types for the first time in this little programme.

To run it you'll need go installed on your computer. Download or clone this repo then just run the `main.go` file with

```sh
go run main.go
```
